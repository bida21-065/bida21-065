                <p>Gaborone International Music and Culture Week (GIMC) is a multi-disciplinary annual event in Gaborone, Botswana. Founded in August 2014, the week-long event is held every first week of September to celebrate the city of Gaborone through music, theatre, comedy, poetry, fashion and other cultural activities. The GIMC calendar resonates with the country’s independence celebrations that are held in the same month.

                  The event is famed for inviting top artists in the region to perform alongside international musicians. Some of the proceeds from the event are donated to NGOs that seek to uplift less fortunate members of the community.
                  
                  Esteemed for luring people from different cultural backgrounds, the high-profile event features artists from countries like Botswana, South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Nigeria, Uganda, US and others.
                  
                  The platform has to date hosted over 200 artists across all genres, making it one of the biggest events in the region. Notable artists that have showcased at GIMC include: Kirk Whalum (US), Jonathan Butler (US), Black Coffee (SA), Basketmouth (Nigeria), Salavado (Uganda), Jah Prayzah (Zimbabwe), Elemotho (Namibia), Gareth Cliff (SA), DJ Fresh (BW), Cassper Nyovest (SA), A.T.I (BW) and more.
                  
                  GIMC is a truly international event that caters for all races and tastes. Below are its objectives: • Promote local tourism • Attract tourists to Gaborone, Botswana • Create platform for local artists and culture to forge partnerships with international peers • Create platform for Botswana brands to reach out locally and internationally • Boost local economy (hotels, transport, restaurants, services etc.) Employment creation for the youth • Showcase our culture to the outside world • Celebrate Gaborone city • Showcase eventing as a form of powerful communication medium</p>
