            <P>Living conditions have improved for the Botswana people, and poverty has fallen significantly.<br>
               The share of the population living on less than $1.90 a day at the 2011 Purchasing Power Parity declined<br>
                steadily from 29.8% to 18.2% between 2002–03 and 2009–10,<br>
                and to 16.1% in 2015-16. This rapid poverty reduction can be attributed mainly to a combination of<br>
                 increasing agricultural incomes, including subsidies, and demographic changes. 

              Progress in reducing poverty has been accompanied by improvements in shared prosperity.<br>
               The growth rate of consumption per capita between 2009–10 and 2015-16 for the bottom 40 percentile of the<br>
                population was 0.42% annually, <br>
                higher than the growth rate of the top 60 percentile. However, Botswana's performance was only in the<br>
                 middle of the worldwide shared-prosperity distribution.
              
              Inequality has fallen as well, albeit still being high. Between 2010 and 2015, inequality,<br>
               measured by the Gini index, fell from 60.5% to 53.3%. Among factors associated with Botswana's declining<br>
                income inequality, the key one is regional convergence due to fast growth in rural areas and demographic<br>
                 changes.
              
              The recent Botswana Multi-Topic Survey: Labour Force Module Report indicates that the unemployment rate has<br>
               gone up to 24.5% with youth unemployment (32.4%) posing a critical challenge. Addressing these challenges<br>
                will require improving the quality of infrastructure (water and electricity), essential basic services<br>
                 (education, health, and social safety nets),<br> as well as accelerating reforms to the business<br>
                  environment and effective support for entrepreneurship.</P>
